Additionally, I contributed to the development of Price After, focusing particularly on implementing the price calculator and reviewing Spanish translations as a copywriter. This innovative application uses the phone's camera to calculate the final price of products on restaurant menus, including taxes and tips, based on the U.S. state in which it is used.",
